This list is just a collection of thesis ideas that were already formulated.
We always have more interesting ideas, which were not written down yet, on the topics *operating systems*, *real-time systems*, *dependability*,  *software variability*, etc.
So, if this list is empty, you find none of the presented thesis ideas interesting, or you have this one brilliant idea you want to pursue, just come around or write a mail.
